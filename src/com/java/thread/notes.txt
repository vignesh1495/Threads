A Java Application:

A single process (JVM) --> Consists of various threads --> Application thread (responsible for running main method)
--> others threads for runtime concerns like garbage collections
















operating scheduler(system) makes a runnable tread to be running.
 Synchronization:
 	make sure two threads don't simultaneously access a critical data element
 	control Data, not code
 	It is a JVM feature
 	how to implement:
 		blockcode -- isolatethis (accessible by one thread at a time)
 		synchronized () {
 		
 		}
